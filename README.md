The code we wrote is available in this repository.

I invite you to go check out [https://www.w3schools.com/html/](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) as they have endless ressources to get started with more HTML and CSS.

If you're looking for something that resembles a class environment a little bit more, [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) proposes challenges (including a portfolio challenge) to help you master HTML, CSS and many other web technologies.

Feel free to send me questions if you need any help!
